## bioscape

bioscape is an extremely early experiment for a multiplayer game with authoritative server and entity component system architecture. Due to the nature, major changes are expected and you shouldn't rely on anything you see here for the time being.


### Contributing

Due to the extremely early phase of the project, there really isn't much to contribute. Bug reports and code improvements are very welcome though!
